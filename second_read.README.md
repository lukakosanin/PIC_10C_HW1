This project is designed to play the spanish game of barajas against the user.
The user is first asked how much they want to bet and then they and the dealer are given a card.
After seeing the card the user is asked if they want to draw another card or not.
The game continues until the user busts or stops asking for cards.
Then the dealer pulls their hand stopping at an earlier sum to prevent busting.
The cards are compared and if the player still has money he can keep betting.
